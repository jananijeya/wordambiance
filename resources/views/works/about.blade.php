                            This site was made with me and my friends in mind, and hopefully, will be used by you and your friends too.
                            Who am I? I'm just a simple girl in a large, wonderous and mysterious world. Delving into its depths, flipping
                            through its pages and investigating all the minute details is what my writing, and my life, is about. :) <3
